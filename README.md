# Neural network based image classification in the context of archaeology

For my Master's Thesis I applied convolutional artifical neural networks to archaeological image data from [Arachne](http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/drupal/). I used the [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) framework created by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center and evaluated different kinds of machine learning methods for doing image classification.

The thesis can be downloaded as PDF [here](http://dersmon.net/thesis_webdemo/masters_thesis.pdf).

Some exampels for classification results can be found [here](http://dersmon.net/thesis_webdemo/).
